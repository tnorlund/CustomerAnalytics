## Customer Churn

*Customer churn* is determined by whether the customer decides to finish their relationship with a company. 

Companies can monitor how often customers leave their business by watching customer churn. The following data is an example of how a telecommunications business can use customer churn to make better business decisions.

### Data

The customer's demographics are recorded in this situation. The recorded demographics are:
- the customer's gender
- whether the customer is a senior citizen
- whether the customer has a partner
- whether the customer has dependents
- how much tenure the customer has with the company

The company also offers internet services for its customers. The customer's options for the internet the company offers are whether the customer choses:
- to have the internet service
- to protect themselves using the company's online security
- to backup their devices online

Not only does the company offer an internet service, the company offers a phone service. Each customer can chose to have the phone service, and they also have the option to obtain multiple lines.
